# Predictive-Maintenance-of-IC-Engine
The goal of the "Predictive Maintenance of IC Engine" project is to use sensor data and machine learning techniques to proactively identify possible problems with automobile engines. An effort was made to forecast maintenance needs ahead of time by examining a number of characteristics, including engine RPM, lubrication oil pressure, fuel pressure, coolant pressure, lubrication oil temperature, and coolant temperature. By using preventative measures, automobile engines may become much more dependable and long-lasting, which will increase safety and save downtime.
