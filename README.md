# Predictive-Maintenance-of-IC-Engine
This project's main goal is to use machine learning techniques to create a predictive maintenance system for automotive engines. The objective is to properly foresee possible failures or maintenance needs based on real-time sensor data, so allowing for prompt intervention and minimizing costly breakdowns.
